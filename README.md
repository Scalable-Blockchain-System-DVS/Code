# Scalable-Blockchain-DVS
A Scalable Blockchain-based Smart Contract model for Decentralized Voltage Stability Using Sharding Technique
This study implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm using blockchain-based smart contracts for evaluating the performance of blockchains in real-time control.This project also investigate sharding mechanisms as a means of improving the systemâ€™s scalability.





we used [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) as our blockchain platform, the [Matpower](https://matpower.org/about/get-started/) library in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and [Hyperledger Caliper](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/caliper) as our performance evaluation tool. For simulationg the sharding behaviour we used channel concept.(getting help from [this project](https://github.com/blockchain-systems/ScaleSFL))


## Getting Started
Make sure you have the proper Hyperledger Fabric [prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/prereqs.html). we used following versions for implementing this project:


To get the binaries required to run the project, you can run this command in the rootfolder of DVS project:
